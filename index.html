      <p>Hello! My name is Harsh. I was born in India and moved to America in 2002. Since then I’ve lived in Northeast Philadelphia. I did my Undergraduate at Temple University and loved all the ups and downs during my stay there. The tough times taught me that nothing in this world is easy and that I should not take anything for granted.</p>

      <p>I value my family and friends, without them I would not be the person I am today. They constantly push me to my limits and they helped mold me into what I am today. I look at the sacrifices my parents have made and use that as a fuel to fire my success.</p>

      <p>I enjoy watching football and basketball during my free time. Ever since I moved to America, I grew up watching the Eagles and the Sixers. Yes, I was a fan when the Sixers were tanking year after year. Watching them loose every year taught me that success doesn’t come overnight, you need to work hard for what you want to earn.</p>
